GreatFree as a Generic and Self-Contained Programming Paradigm for the Distributed Computing Environment over the Internet

As a generic and self-contained programming paradigm for the distributed computing environment over the Internet, GreatFree is characterized by the three essential techniques, including the Distributed Primitives (DP), the Asynchronous Messaging on the Thread Level (AMTL) and the Steady Patterns for Rich Application (SPRA) programming interfaces. The DP is a series of fundamental programming elements with their corresponding code-level design patterns, which hide tedious underlying technical details to raise the programming efficiency as well as compose advanced components for complicated scenarios. The AMTL not only eases the concurrency programming to develop asynchronous systems by default but also makes threading visible to design sophisticated concurrent mechanisms. The SPRA unveils that numerous heterogeneous distributed systems can be implemented with the distributed programming components of GreatFree in a limited number of homogeneous code-level design patterns. It proves that GreatFree is self-contained and generic such that developers are allowed to work with the paradigm only to program various distributed systems conveniently. Because of the highly patterned implementation, a new high-level language is feasible to be proposed for more simplified distributed programming.

GreatFree achieves the goal to be a self-contained generic programming paradigm in the distributed computing environment over the Internet through its three crucial techniques, including the Distributed Primitives (DP), the Asynchronous Messaging on the Thread Level (AMTL) and the Steady Patterns for Rich Application programming interfaces (SPRA). The DP is a series of fundamental distributed application programming interfaces with their corresponding code-level design patterns. It hides developers from tedious underlying techniques to raise the efficiency of distributed programming. On the other hand, it is also used to compose advanced components for complicated distributed scenarios. Compared with the Synchronous and Standalone Paradigm (SSP) the AMTL represents a new programming perspective that implements asynchronous and distributed systems by default. Different from existing Asynchronous and Distributed Paradigms (ADP) threading is visible upon asynchronous messaging in GreatFree such that developers are allowed to program sophisticated concurrent mechanisms with accurate concurrency degrees. The SPRA unveils that heterogeneous distributed systems can be programmed with a limited number of homogeneous code-level design patterns of GreatFree. It indicates that GreatFree is self-contained and generic. Working with it only, various distributed systems are implemented in a highly efficient way. More important, founded on the highly patterned implementation, a new high-level programming language is feasible to be proposed for more simplified distributed programming.

With the development of the Internet, the distributed computing environment becomes complicated enough such that traditional programming languages which are categorized as the SSP, can hardly be used to develop distributed systems for the environment. Because of their synchronous and standalone perspective, tremendous effort is required to program an asynchronous and distributed system, especially when its circumstance becomes intricate. Using the SSP, developers have to take care of numerous issues, such as resource management network programming concurrency programming synchronous management distributed multicasting distributed clustering distributed persisting and so forth. For that, even proficient developers avoid programming distributed systems with those approaches directly.

For that, many Distributed Frameworks Paradigms (DFP) are put forward to simplify distributed programming in the distributed computing environment over the Internet. The primary solution of the DFP is to construct a virtualized synchronous and standalone computing environment that wraps the underlying asynchronous and distributed techniques. Thus, developers are able to focus on implementing high-level applications in the traditional programming manner. However, for the complexity of distributed computing environment over the Internet, it is impossible to encapsulate all of the tedious distributed programming details and construct a synchronous and standalone programming context. Therefore, although the approach is highly efficient, until now, each of those frameworks depends rigorously on one specific application domain in a homogeneous distributed computing environment.

Besides the above two paradigms, a couple of general-purpose solutions, i.e., the ADP, are proposed to take the responsibility of programming distributed systems in either the homogeneous environment or the heterogeneous one. All of them turn out to be asynchronous and distributed by nature such that it saves enormous effort compared with that using the SSP. In contrast, different from the DFP, the ADP is also isolated from specific application domains and distributed environments to a high extent. However, until now, the ADP is still not evolved sufficiently such that the scope of distributed programming is still constrained heavily in homogeneous environments. For complicated cases, traditional programming approaches have to be introduced to resolve new challenges and therefore it still causes high cost of development. For that, the existing ADP ones has not evolved to be a self-contained and generic solution. The current solutions are more closed to be the DFP than to the ideal ADP.

As one member of the category of the ADP, GreatFree overcomes the problems of the current solutions with its three distinguished techniques, i.e., the DP, the AMTL and the SPRA. For that, GreatFree claims to be a self-contained generic distributed programming paradigm.

The DP specifies a series of fundamental distributed programming elements with their corresponding code-level design patterns. The DP consists of two rudimentary programming components, i.e., the distributed modeling and the distributed dispatching, which encapsulate tedious underlying programming details, such as networking threading and resource management. The distributed modeling turns a standalone physical computer into a distributed node and the distributed dispatching supports the scaling-up concurrency within the distributed node to process incoming messages. Through programming with the DP following their patterns, the simple distributed systems, i.e., the lightweight messaging Two-Node Client/Server (TNCS) or the Multiple-Node Client/Server (MNCS), can be constructed conveniently. However, the extraordinary characteristic of the DP plays the role of the fundamental elements to compose various advanced distributed programming components, which are the high-level building blocks to construct complicated distributed systems. As a self-contained programming paradigm, all of the advanced components are originated from the DP and each of the advanced ones are still composable.

The AMTL eases the concurrency programming with the asynchronous messaging approach as well. Although that is widely adopted in all of the solutions of the ADP, the AMTL is distinguished from others by the visibility of threading. Programmers are able to manipulate threads directly through asynchronous messaging. It overcomes the potential problems of hiding threading in any other ADP solutions. Since threading is invisible in the other ADP solutions, it is difficult for programmers to implement precise concurrent algorithms to deal with complicated distributed scenarios. That is the unique way to raise the performance as well as lower the cost of computing resources in complicated computing environments since it is the common sense that a threading management mechanism is required to be designed case by case. In either the homogeneous environment or the heterogeneous one, threading is required to be programmed directly to process diverse unpredictable distributed tasks. On the other hand, to lower the programming burden, different from the SSP, the threading in the AMTL is established not on the basis of memory-sharing but on that of message-passing, i.e., asynchronous messaging. Thus, the AMTL threading gains the advantages of the ADP concurrency as well as the flexibility of the SSP threading.

The SPRA discloses one important phenomenon in the programs of various distributed systems implemented by GreatFree. Even though there are various heterogeneous systems, the code structures of those systems follow a limited number of the homogeneous code-level design patterns, proposed by GreatFree. That is a solid evidence of GreatFree as a self-contained and generic programming paradigm for the distributed computing environment over the Internet. In addition, because of the principle, it reminds that a new generic and self-contained programming language is feasible to be proposed upon the tens of the compatible patterned code structures. The language must simplify the distributed programming further in the heterogeneous computing environments over the Internet.
