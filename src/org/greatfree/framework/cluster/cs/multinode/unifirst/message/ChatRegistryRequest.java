		ChatRegistryRequest/ChatRegistryResponse needs to be broadcast such that each child has all of the users' information.
		
		ChatPartnerRequest/ChatPartnerResponse is restored to be performed in the way of 1st principle.
		
		In short, the original solution is restored.
		
		To optimize further, the only issue is whether ChatRegistryRequest/ChatRegistryResponse can be performed in the way of unicasting, i.e., the 1st principle or the 2nd one.
		
		To do that, it is necessary to take into account intercasting, i.e., the 3rd principle.
