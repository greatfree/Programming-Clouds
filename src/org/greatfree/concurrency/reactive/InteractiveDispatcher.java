/*
 * This is a more complicated thread. Besides the feature of NotificationObjectQueue, it is able to interact with its thread pool, i.e., InteractiveDispatcher, to notify its current status and even make a decision based on its status. In contrast, the thread pool can determine how to schedule tasks to those threads and how to maintain the life cycle of those threads in accordance with the status notifications from the thread. It is made use of the case when the work load is high and each of tasks can hardly be evaluated heavy or light prior to being executed. Thus, running status has to be notified by the thread itself after working on the load for some time. 05/24/2017, Bing Li

/*
 * This is a task dispatcher which schedules tasks to the special type of threads derived from InteractiveQueue. For the distinct designs, instances of managed threads can interact with the dispatcher for high quality management. 11/21/2014, Bing Li
 * 
 * Different from classic dispatchers, the interactive pool splits the threads into two types, the fast one and the slow one. However, the splitting is performed upon interactions between the dispatcher and those threads. 11/21/2014, Bing Li
